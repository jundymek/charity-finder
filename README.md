## Charity Finder - simple project written in Typescript
It is one of the intermediate task from [florinpop17](https://github.com/florinpop17). A full description is here: [https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/Charity-Finder-App.md](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/Charity-Finder-App.md).

It is a project written for learning React with Typescript.

### Technologies and tools used in this project ðŸš€:
- React (with hooks),
- Typescript,
- React-select library ([https://react-select.com/home](https://react-select.com/home)),
- GlobalGiving API ([https://www.globalgiving.org/api/](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/https://www.globalgiving.org/api/)),
- VS Code. 

Because of weak API (in my opinion - lack of sorting options for example) I lightly modified tasks (filtering data after loading first part of data).

I tried to style it properly (it is fully responsive) and of course, write semantic code.
